== Research Interests

I am interested in *building AI systems to better serve every human being, especialy for complex intellectual activities*.

Specifically, I am interested in the following topics:
- Large Language Model (LLM)
- AI for (Advanced)
  -- Education (e.g. [https://eurekalabs.ai Eureka Labs])
  -- Research (e.g. [https://scicode-bench.github.io/ SciCode-Bench])
  -- Software Engineering (e.g. [https://www.swebench.com SWE-Bench])
- Scalable AlignmentÔºàe.g. [https://www.anthropic.com/index/core-views-on-ai-safety Scalable Oversight])
- Hardware-Algorithm Co-Design (e.g. [https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention Flash Attention])
